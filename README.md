# SudokuSolver
Solves a sudoku puzzle, using logic and deduction, then guessing based on possibility model

Notes on use: In order to end the program prematurely, just use a SIGINT (^C from a terminal or close the terminal).
Additionally, some explanations on terms: A possibility map just shows how many possible solutions exist for each spot
    on the puzzle, and a solution level shows where a solution (1-9) is possible (including places that have already been solved).
